    "Before we can retrieve answers or build intelligent applications, we need to ensure that our document data is well-managed. This chapter focuses on the often-overlooked but essential tasks of **document ingestion**, **inspection**, and **modification** using `LlamaIndex`. Whether we're inserting new data, examining existing nodes, or attempting tricky operations like deletion and updates, understanding how your index handles documents and nodes is critical.\n",

    "- View and inspect stored documents and their internal node structures.\n",

    "- Add new nodes or re-ingest documents using transformation pipelines.\n",
    "\n",

Agent AI systems that generate content can be used to manipulate or deceive people. Therefore, it is very important that this technology is developed in accordance with responsible AI guidelines. For example, explicitly communicating to users that content is generated by an AI system and providing the user with controls in order to customize such a system. It is possible the Agent AI could be used to develop new methods to detect manipulative content - partly because it is rich with hallucination performance of large foundation model - and thus help address another real world problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor examples, 1) in health topic, ethical deployment of LLM and VLM agents, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, is paramount. AI agents trained on biased data could potentially worsen health disparities by providing inaccurate diagnoses for underrepresented groups. Moreover, the handling of sensitive patient data by AI agents raises significant privacy and confidentiality concerns. 2) In the gaming industry, AI agents could transform the role of developers, shifting their focus from scripting non-player characters to refining agent learning processes. Similarly, adaptive robotic systems could redefine manufacturing roles, necessitating new skill sets rather than replacing human workers. Navigating these transitions responsibly is vital to minimize potential socio-economic disruptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the agent AI focuses on learning collaboration policy in simulation and there is some risk if directly applying the policy to the real world due to the distribution shift. Robust testing and continual safety monitoring mechanisms should be put in place to minimize risks of unpredictable behaviors in real-world scenarios. Our “VideoAnalytica\" dataset is collected from the Internet and considering which is not a fully representative source, so we already go through-ed the ethical review and legal process from both Microsoft and University Washington. Be that as it may, we also need to understand biases that might exist in this corpus. Data distributions can be characterized in many ways. In this workshop, we have captured how the agent level distribution in our dataset is different from other existing datasets. However, there is much more than could be included in a single dataset or workshop. We would argue that there is a need for more approaches or discussion linked to real tasks or topics and that by making these data or system available.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will dedicate a segment of our project to discussing these ethical issues, exploring potential mitigation strategies, and deploying a responsible multi-modal AI agent.
